guardrails:
  - Never commit API keys, tokens, or keystore files.
  - Validate AI-generated code with tests and human review before merging.
  - Ensure user data is collected and stored in compliance with privacy policies.
  - Maintain UI consistency across all activities (see docs/UI_PATTERNS.md)
  - Follow established architecture patterns (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - Keep activities under 400 lines - extract logic to ViewModels/Use Cases
  - Use dependency injection for testability
  - All new features must include documentation updates
